Navigation and Geometry Utilities for Satellite Control

Shared mathematical and geometric utility functions for satellite navigation.
Used by both real hardware and simulation controllers for consistent behavior.

Utility functions:
- Angle normalization and shortest-path difference calculation
- Point-to-line distance for path tracking
- Safe path generation with obstacle avoidance
- Linear and circular interpolation for trajectories
- Geometric calculations for waypoint navigation

Key features:
- Handles angle wrapping around ±π correctly
- Prevents 270° transition issues with shortest-path logic
- Circular obstacle avoidance for safe navigation
- Shared between simulation and hardware for consistency
